## About Me
* Hello! I'm Anas, a 23-year-old coffee lover ☕ (maybe a bit too much) and the ability to juggle 3 balls (4th incoming)!
* I enjoy building end-to-end data solutions, focused more on analytical and predictive modeling so far, and working on adding a software/data engineering skillset 💻 to give my projects some life.
* I am currently a Data Scientist intern at SITA, a global leader in IT and communication for the aviation sector ✈️

## Technical Skills
* **Machine Learning**: Expertise in building predictive models.
* **Data Manipulation**: Proficient in handling and analyzing large datasets.
* **Signal Processing**: Deep understanding and practical knowledge of Fourier analysis, filters, and signal transformation techniques
* **Statistics**: Strong understanding of statistical methods and hypothesis tests
* **Computer Vision**: Experience in processing and analyzing visual data.
* **Communication**: Used to explaining (among other things) the difference between precision and accuracy to non technical people
