## About Me
* Hello! I'm Anas, a 24-year-old coffee lover ‚òï (maybe a bit too much)
* I enjoy building end-to-end data solutions, focused more on analytical and predictive modeling so far, and working on adding a software/data engineering skillset üíª to give my projects some life
* I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at SITA, a global leader in IT and communication for the aviation sector ‚úàÔ∏è

## Technical Skills
* **Machine Learning**: Regression, Classification, Time Series Analysis.
* **Data Manipulation**: Data Cleaning, Parsing, Visualization, and Plotting.
* **Signal Processing**: Fourier Analysis, Filtering, Signal Transformations.
* **Statistics**: Correlation, Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA, Statistical Modeling.
* **Software Development**: Modular Programming, Unit Testing, Code Optimization.
* **MLOps**: Docker, CI/CD Pipelines (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions), Bash Scripting.
* **Computer Vision**: Image Processing with OpenCV, PIL, and related libraries.
* **Communication**: Ability to explain (among other things) the difference between precision and accuracy to non-technical folks
