## About Me
* Hello! I'm Anas, a 23-year-old coffee lover ☕ (maybe a bit too much)
* I enjoy building end-to-end data solutions, focused more on analytical and predictive modeling so far, and working on adding a software/data engineering skillset 💻 to give my projects some life
* I am currently a Data Scientist intern at SITA, a global leader in IT and communication for the aviation sector ✈️
